# Portable snake implementation
A driver that processes a snake game and gives the user the ability to flush the current frame buffer with a self defined function. Mainly aimed at the usage on embedded platforms. See the main.c file for a example usage. 

## WIP
  - Still uses parts of Standard library.
  - ~~Not all possible errors are handled properly.~~
  - ~~Square drawing algorithm can be improved speed-wise.~~
  - No sound support (yet).
  - ~~No custom color support (yet).~~
